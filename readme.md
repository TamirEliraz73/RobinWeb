# Robin Website Documentation & Features

## Overview

Welcome to Robin! ðŸŒŸ This is a fun and friendly React application dedicated to documenting the game ***Robin***, which
I'm building in another project using ```libGDX``` in ```Java```.

Here, you can find all the cool stuff about the gameâ€”like characters, levels, and awesome game mechanics! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

### Key Features

- **Game Documentation**: Dive into exciting guides and details about gameplay and adventures!
- **Responsive Design**: No matter where you areâ€”on a phone, tablet, or computerâ€”this site looks great everywhere!
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Get ready for stylish and easy-to-change designs!

Curious about the game? Check out the source code and the latest updates on
my [GitHub](https://github.com/TamirEliraz73/Robin)! ðŸš€ Whether youâ€™re a player looking to improve your skills or a
fellow developer who wants to see how itâ€™s made, this site is here to help you explore the world of ***Robin!***
